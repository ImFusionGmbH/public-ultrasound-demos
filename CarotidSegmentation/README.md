# Carotid Segmentation

## Summary

This dataset contains a caroid artery B-mode example and a simple Torch model (U-net) to segment the artery automatically in it.

The model was trained only on a very limited set of recordings on a single scanner, so it's not expected to generalize well to other subjects or scanners.
